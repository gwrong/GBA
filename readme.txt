Shameless Flappy Bird Clone 2.0

You are a bird traveling through a sky full of solid rectangles and you want to fly for as long as possible.

Controls

A: flap your wings to gain height (his pixelated wings actually move this time)
L or R: Choose between the Wrap options on the splash screen, if unlocked
Left/Right: (1) Choose difficulty on the splash screen (2) Move your bird left or right while flying (3) Control Link in the "secret" mode (see below)
Start: Advance through menus other than the game itself
Select: Reset/End the game

Modes

Easy - unlocked at the beginning
Hard - unlocked once you get >= 30 on the easy level

No Wrap - unlocked at the beginning, you die if you hit the bottom of the screen
Wrap - When you hit the top of the screen, you will wrap around to the bottom of the screen. Unlocked once you get >= 10 on the hard level

Secret - If you manage to get the bird to the far right side of the screen, you enter the secret level where you can move Link around. You can exit by pressing start or select. 

Winning

Winning is unlocking all the modes and getting to the secret level at least once. You will see an image with an inspirational quote once these conditions are met.
